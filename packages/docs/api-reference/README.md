# API Reference

Welcome to the Tiny Carousel API documentation page! 

This part of the documentation is focused on providing technical description for every public method/property provided by Tiny Carousel ecosystem. 

Use sidebar navigation (or hamburger menu if you’re on mobile) to choose modules you’d like to read about.

:::tip Help us improve the documentation
On the very bottom of every page there is a "Help us improve this page on GitHub" button. Feel free to use it whenever you think that something could be described better or when see you see any typo/error. Don’t hesitate to write a suggestion in the "issues" tab or file a PR with a fix!

Thank you! Any help is kindly appreciated 🙏
