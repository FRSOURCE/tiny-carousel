# Usage

## Core

The main package of the Tiny Carousel [ecosystem](../../ecosystem) which gives the most basic carousel API. Try it out before using additional plugins - it might be enough in the most basic scenarios.


For further information about the possible configuration options and useful methods, please have a look at our [API reference](../../api-reference).
