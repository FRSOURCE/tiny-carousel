# Introduction

**Tiny carousel** is a modular slider based on the modern CSS snap points technique. This makes the library fully customizable, really lightweight and incredibly performant with the smoothest mobile drag & drop support ever possible!

## Why

Our team needed to add multiple carousel instances to the single view for a cross-platform project. Unfortunately, every other possible solution was too heavy to work well under harsh environment of the low-end mobile devices. To overcome this problem we have created **tiny carousel**!

## How does it work

**Tiny carousel** is a name for the whole ecosystem of modules that can be used to setup a hugely customized slider for your web app! The main part is the **core** module which creates the simplest form of carousel and allows to extend it by adding other plugins.

The main sliding functionality is based on the [CSS scroll-snap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap) and is supported by every [modern browser](https://caniuse.com/?search=scroll%20snap). This gives the library a native-like responsiveness and makes it a really lightweight solution. To understand scroll snapping better we suggest to read [this great article published on CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/practical-css-scroll-snapping/).
